# ChromHandler Example: HPLC Data Analysis Training Course

This repository contains a comprehensive training course for analyzing HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) data using the ChromHandler library. The course is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that guide participants through the complete workflow of chromatographic data analysis.

## üìä Data Structure

The `data/` directory contains HPLC experimental data organized as follows:

- **`hplc/calibration/`** - Standard calibration curves for quantitative analysis
  - `adenosine/` - 6 concentration standards (25-800 ŒºM) for adenosine calibration
  - `adenine/` - 6 concentration standards (25-800 ŒºM) for adenine calibration
- **`hplc/kinetics/`** - Time-course kinetic experiments
  - `CF6/`, `CF7/`, `CF8/`, `CF9/`, `CF10/` - Multiple experimental conditions with time points from 0-240 minutes
- **`molecules/`** - Pre-defined molecular entities (adenosine, adenine)
- **`proteins/`** - Protein definitions (SAHH enzyme)
- **`enzymeml.json`** - Complete experimental metadata in EnzymeML format
